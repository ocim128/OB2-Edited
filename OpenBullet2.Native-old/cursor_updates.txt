  * Wordlists.xaml ListView
  * (Configs.xaml, Hits.xaml, Proxies.xaml already had virtualization)

Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation:
- Created CustomCommands.cs with RoutedUICommand definitions
- Added comprehensive keyboard shortcuts:
  * Ctrl+R: Refresh current page
  * Ctrl+Q: Quit application
  * Ctrl+1: Navigate to Home
  * Ctrl+2: Navigate to Jobs
  * Ctrl+3: Navigate to Monitor
  * Ctrl+4: Navigate to Proxies
  * Ctrl+5: Navigate to Wordlists
  * Ctrl+6: Navigate to Configs
  * Ctrl+7: Navigate to Hits
  * Ctrl+8: Navigate to Plugins
  * Ctrl+9: Navigate to OB Settings
  * Ctrl+0: Navigate to RL Settings
  * Escape: Close dialogs (implemented in MainDialog.xaml.cs)

Search & Filter Improvements:
- Enhanced Configs.xaml: Real-time search using TextChanged event instead of KeyDown
- Added search functionality to Hits.xaml with real-time filtering TextBox
- Modified corresponding ViewModels to support instant search results

PHASE 3 COMPLETED ‚úì
-------------------
Auto-Save Functionality:
- Added AutoSaveInterval property to GeneralSettings.cs (default: 30 seconds)
- Implemented DispatcherTimer in ConfigEditor.xaml.cs for periodic auto-saving
- Added UI control in OBSettings.xaml for user configuration
- Bound AutoSaveInterval to OBSettingsViewModel.cs
- Removed intrusive auto-save notifications for better UX

Critical Bug Fixes:
- Fixed runtime crash: Replaced missing 'StyledActionCommandButton' style with 'MahApps.Styles.Button' in ConfirmationDialog.xaml
- Fixed false "unsaved changes" detection by calling Config.UpdateHashes() after save operations in ConfigEditorViewModel
- Resolved XAML resource reference issues

Confirmation Dialogs:
- Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions using existing Alert.Choice method:
  * Config deletion in Configs.xaml.cs
  * Wordlist deletion (DeleteSelected, DeleteAll, DeleteNotFound) in Wordlists.xaml.cs
  * Proxy operations in Proxies.xaml.cs
- Enhanced user safety without breaking existing workflow

Drag & Drop Support:
- Enhanced existing drag-and-drop functionality:
  * Configs: Improved configsListView_Drop for .opk file imports
  * Wordlists: Enhanced HandleDrop for multiple file support
  * Proxies: Improved ProxyListViewDrop for bulk proxy imports
- Added visual feedback during drag operations

CURRENT FOCUS: RURILIB IMPROVEMENTS üéØ
-------------------------------------
Target Areas:
- RuriLib/Blocks/ - Enhanced error handling in all block types
- RuriLib/Http/ - HTTP client optimizations
- RuriLib/Models/Bots/ - Better bot execution error reporting
- RuriLib/Models/Configs/ - Config validation with helpful messages
- RuriLib/Functions/ - Common function optimizations

Implementation Approach:
1. Audit existing error handling in major RuriLib components
2. Replace generic exceptions with specific, actionable error messages
3. Add error context (which block, line, data being processed)
4. Profile and optimize memory usage and performance
5. Implement better progress tracking and logging

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Users can understand and fix errors without external help
- Reduced memory usage during large operations
- Faster execution times for common operations
- Better visibility into RuriLib operations
- Fewer support requests due to unclear errors

FILES TO BE MODIFIED (RuriLib Focus):
-----------------------------------
Core RuriLib Files:
- RuriLib/Blocks/ (all block types for better error handling)
- RuriLib/Http/ (HTTP client optimizations)
- RuriLib/Models/Bots/BotData.cs (memory optimization)
- RuriLib/Models/Configs/ (config validation)
- RuriLib/Functions/ (performance optimizations)
- RuriLib/Extensions/ (frequently used extensions)
